# AI-Agent
In this project, I built my first AI model using TensorFlow/Keras and Scikit-learn. The AI is trained on real-world data for breast cancer diagnosis, allowing it to classify tumors as either benign or malignant with high accuracy.

# Features
Binary Classification: Classifies tumors as benign or malignant.
Real Data: Trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
Machine Learning:
TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network.
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation.

# Technologies Used
Python (3.x)
TensorFlow/Keras
Scikit-learn
Pandas
